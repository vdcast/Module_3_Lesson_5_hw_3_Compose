Reactive programming

**Task:**

Create a game - clicker. The essence of the game - you need to tap on the screen as fast as you can.
The number of taps is recorded as the result. If the result is record - then it's stored in Records Halls.
There are three modes (distances): Sprint (10 seconds), Middle distance (20 seconds) and Marathon (30 seconds).
1) Menu screen: there are buttons "New Challenge", "Records Hall", "About"
2) "New competition" screen: three buttons for different distances and a "Start" button.
3) Competition screen. First, the inscriptions "3", "2", "1", "Start!" are displayed. From this moment, the user's tapas begin to count. On-screen countdown timer.
4) At the end of the time, the result is displayed on the screen (you can also display records for this distance). If the result is a record, then the inscription "New record!" is displayed.
There is a button to return to the menu.
5) The high score screen displays 5 high scores for each distances.

**Result: Screen recoding** (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
